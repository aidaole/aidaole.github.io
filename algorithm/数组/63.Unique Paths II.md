63. Unique Paths II

You are given an m x n integer array grid. There is a robot initially located at the top-left corner (i.e., grid[0][0]). The robot tries to move to the bottom-right corner (i.e., grid[m - 1][n - 1]). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.

An obstacle and space are marked as 1 or 0 respectively in grid. A path that the robot takes cannot include any square that is an obstacle.

Return the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner.

The testcases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to 2 * 109.

这道题主要两种解法: 
1. 回溯, 讲所有路径都列一遍, 找出总数
2. dp.  路径总数是 dp[m-1][n-1] = dp[m-2][n-1] + dp[m-1][n-2] , 因为只有向下和向右两个方向

解法一: 回溯

但是这种写法, 当宿主比较大的时候, 会超时

```python3
class Solution:
    def uniquePathsWithObstacles(self, obstacleGrid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        if not obstacleGrid or obstacleGrid[0][0] == 1:
            return 0

        self.result = 0
        self.go(obstacleGrid, 0, 0)
        return self.result

    def go(self, grid, i, j):
        if i == len(grid)-1 and j == len(grid[0])-1:
            self.result += 1
            return

        if i+1 < len(grid) and grid[i+1][j] == 0:
            grid[i+1][j] = 1
            self.go(grid, i+1, j)
            grid[i+1][j] = 0

        if j+1 < len(grid[0]) and grid[i][j+1] == 0:
            grid[i][j+1] = 1
            self.go(grid, i, j+1)
            grid[i][j+1] = 0
        
```

解法二: DP

```python3
class Solution:
    def uniquePathsWithObstacles(self, obstacleGrid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        if not obstacleGrid or obstacleGrid[0][0] == 1:
            return 0
        m, n = len(obstacleGrid), len(obstacleGrid[0])
        print(m, n)
        dp = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(m)]
        dp[0][0] = 1
        for i in range(1, m):
            dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0] if (obstacleGrid[i][0] == 0) else 0
        for j in range(1, n):
            dp[0][j] = dp[0][j-1] if (obstacleGrid[0][j] == 0) else 0

        for i in range(1, m):
            for j in range(1, n):
                if obstacleGrid[i][j] == 0:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = 0
         
        return dp[m-1][n-1]
```
